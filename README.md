# magic city
p5.js demo project

:no_mobile_phones::microphone:
  * *use [google chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), a microphone and a display thats 1200px+ wide for the best experience.*
  * *the city will react to your microphone input, so you need to allow microphone access for the page.*

i was trying to get my head around simple animation concepts, so i created this demo project using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). the city will react to the mircophone input in various ways. most element positions and sizes are calculated dynamically, so it depends on your display, how the city looks.
